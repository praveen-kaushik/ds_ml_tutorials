    "# Text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to process and understand text is one of the first steps on the journey to\n",
    "getting meaningful insights from textual data. Though it is important to understand\n",
    "how language is structured and specific text syntax patterns, that alone is not sufficient\n",
    "to be of much use to businesses and organizations who want to derive useful patterns\n",
    "and insights and get maximum use out of their vast volumes of text data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most relevant and challenging problems is text classification or\n",
    "categorization, which involves trying to organize text documents into various categories\n",
    "based on inherent properties or attributes of each text document. This is used in\n",
    "various domains, including email spam identification and news categorization. The\n",
    "concept may seem simple, and if you have a small number of documents, you can look\n",
    "at each document and gain some idea about what it is trying to indicate. Based on\n",
    "this knowledge, you can group similar documents into categories or classes. Itâ€™s more\n",
    "challenging when the number of text documents to be classified increases to several\n",
    "hundred thousands or millions. This is where techniques like feature extraction and\n",
    "supervised or unsupervised ML come in handy. Document classification is a generic\n",
    "problem not limited to text alone but also can be extended for other items like music,\n",
    "images, video, and other media.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize our problem more clearly, we will have a given set of classes or\n",
    "categories and several text documents. Remember that documents are basically sentences\n",
    "or paragraphs of text. This forms a corpus. Our task would be to determine which class\n",
    "or classes each document belongs to.  \n",

    "## What Is Text Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we define text classification, we need to understand the scope of textual data and\n",
    "what we really mean by classification. The textual data involved here can be anything\n",
    "ranging from a phrase, sentence, or a complete document with paragraphs of text, which\n",
    "can be obtained from corpora, blogs, or anywhere from the Web. Text classification is\n",
    "also often called document classification just to cover all forms of textual content under\n",
    "the word document. The word document could be defined as some form of concrete\n",
    "representation of thoughts or events that could be in the form of writing, recorded\n",
    "speech, drawings, or presentations. I use the term document here to represent textual\n",
    "data such as sentences or paragraphs belonging to the English language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Text or document classification is the process of assigning text documents into one\n",
    "or more classes or categories, assuming that we have a predefined set of classes.\n",
    "Documents here are textual documents, and each document can contain a sentence or\n",
    "even a paragraph of words. A text classification system would successfully be able to\n",
    "classify each document to its correct class(es) based on inherent properties of the\n",
    "document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few types of text classification based on the number of classes to predict\n",
    "and the nature of predictions. These types of classification are based on the dataset, the\n",
    "number of classes/categories pertaining to that dataset, and the number of classes that\n",
    "can be predicted on any data point:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary classification** is when the total number of distinct classes\n",
    "or categories is two in number and any prediction can contain\n",
    "either one of those classes.  \n",
    "- **Multi-class classification**, also known as multinomial\n",
    "classification, refers to a problem where the total number of\n",
    "classes is more than two, and each prediction gives one class\n",
    "or category that can belong to any of those classes. This is an\n",
    "extension of the binary classification problem where the total\n",
    "number of classes is more than two.  \n",
    "- **Multi-label classification** refers to problems where each prediction\n",
    "can yield more than one outcome/predicted class for any data\n",
    "point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I would like to highlight a great example. In the summer of 2016, two interesting NLP papers were published by Facebook Research, [Bojanowski et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606) and [Joulin et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759). The first one proposed a new method for word embedding and the second one a method for text classification. The authors also opensourced a C++ library with the implementation of these methods, [fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText), that rapidly attracted a lot of interest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will discuss how to easily implement several projects using a python wrapper of fastText, [fastText.py](https://github.com/salestock/fastText.py)."
